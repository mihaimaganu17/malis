use crate::Interpreter;

// The resolver visits every node in the syntax tree and could perform the following actions:
// - Define a new scope
// - Append to an existing scope
// - Remove a scope
// The ultimate goal is to find a resolution for each variable access, according to the scope it is
// defined in. As such, the following nodes are of interest:
// - A block statement introduces a new scope for the statements it contains.
// - A function declaration introduces a new scope for its body and binds its parameters in that
// scope.
// - A variable declaration adds a new variable to the current scope.
// - Variable and assignment expressions need to have their variables resolved.
